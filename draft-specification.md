# Specifications

### Status of this document

This document is a work-in-progress specification defining the Matroska file format as part of the [IETF Cellar working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cellar/charter/). But since it's quite complete it is used as a reference for the development of libmatroska. Legacy versions of the specification can be found [here](/files/matroska.pdf) (PDF doc by Alexander Noé -- outdated).

For a simplified diagram of the layout of a Matroska file, see the [Diagram page](../diagram/index.html).

A more refined and detailed version of the EBML specifications is being [worked on here](https://github.com/Matroska-Org/ebml-specification/blob/master/specification.markdown).

The table found below is now generated from the "source" of the Matroska specification. This [XML file](https://github.com/Matroska-Org/foundation-source/blob/master/spectool/specdata.xml) is also used to generate the semantic data used in libmatroska and libmatroska2\. We encourage anyone to use and monitor its changes so your code is spec-proof and always up to date.

Note that versions 1, 2 and 3 have been finalized. Version 4 is currently work in progress. There may be further additions to v4.


### Basis in EBML

Matroska is a Document Type of EBML (Extensible Binary Meta Language). This specification is dependent on the [EBML Specification](https://github.com/Matroska-Org/ebml-specification/blob/master/specification.markdown). For an understanding of Matroska's EBML Schema, see in particular the sections of the EBML Specification covering [EBML Element Types](https://github.com/Matroska-Org/ebml-specification/blob/master/specification.markdown#ebml-element-types), [EBML Schema](https://github.com/Matroska-Org/ebml-specification/blob/master/specification.markdown#ebml-schema), and [EBML Structure](https://github.com/Matroska-Org/ebml-specification/blob/master/specification.markdown#structure).

## Elements semantic

A more detailed description of the column headers can be found in the [Specification Notes](notes.html#Table_Columns).

If you are interrested in WebM you can have a look at this page that describes what [parts of Matroska it kept](http://www.webmproject.org/code/specs/container/).

*   Element Name - The full name of the described element.

**All top-levels elements (Segment and direct sub-elements) are coded on 4 octets, i.e. class D elements.**

### Appendix

#### Language Codes

Language codes can be either the 3 letters [bibliographic ISO-639-2](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/English_list.php) form (like "fre" for french), or such a language code followed by a dash and a country code for specialities in languages (like "fre-ca" for Canadian French). Country codes are the same as used for [internet domains](http://www.iana.org/cctld/cctld-whois.htm).

#### Physical Types

Each level can have different meanings for audio and video. The ORIGINAL_MEDIUM tag can be used to specify a string for ChapterPhysicalEquiv = 60\. Here is the list of possible levels for both audio and video :

| ChapterPhysicalEquiv | Audio | Video | Comment |
| 70 | SET / PACKAGE | SET / PACKAGE | the collection of different media |
| 60 | CD / 12" / 10" / 7" / TAPE / MINIDISC / DAT | DVD / VHS / LASERDISC | the physical medium like a CD or a DVD |
| 50 | SIDE | SIDE | when the original medium (LP/DVD) has different sides |
| 40 | - | LAYER | another physical level on DVDs |
| 30 | SESSION | SESSION | as found on CDs and DVDs |
| 20 | TRACK | - | as found on audio CDs |
| 10 | INDEX | - | the first logical level of the side/medium |


#### Block Structure

Size = 1 + (1-8) + 4 + (4 + (4)) octets. So from 6 to 21 octets.

Bit 0 is the most significant bit.

Frames using references should be stored in "coding order". That means the references first and then the frames referencing them. A consequence is that timecodes may not be consecutive. But a frame with a past timecode must reference a frame already known, otherwise it's considered bad/void.

There can be many Blocks in a BlockGroup provided they all have the same timecode. It is used with different parts of a frame with different priorities.

| Block Header |
| Offset | Player | Description |
| 0x00+ | must | Track Number (Track Entry). It is coded in EBML like form (1 octet if the value is < 0x80, 2 if < 0x4000, etc) (most significant bits set to increase the range). |
| 0x01+ | must | Timecode (relative to Cluster timecode, signed int16) |
| 0x03+ | - | 

| Flags |
| Bit | Player | Description |
| 0-3 | - | Reserved, set to 0 |
| 4 | - | Invisible, the codec should decode this frame but not display it |
| 5-6 | must | Lacing

*   00 : no lacing
*   01 : Xiph lacing
*   11 : EBML lacing
*   10 : fixed-size lacing

 |
| 7 | - | not used |

 |
| Lace (when lacing bit is set) |
| 0x00 | must | Number of frames in the lace-1 (uint8) |
| 0x01 / 0xXX | must* | Lace-coded size of each frame of the lace, except for the last one (multiple uint8). *This is not used with Fixed-size lacing as it is calculated automatically from (total size of lace) / (number of frames in lace). |
| (possibly) Laced Data |
| 0x00 | must | Consecutive laced frames |


### Lacing

Lacing is a mechanism to save space when storing data. It is typically used for small blocks of data (refered to as frames in matroska). There are 3 types of lacing : the Xiph one inspired by what is found in the Ogg container, the EBML one which is the same with sizes coded differently and the fixed-size one where the size is not coded. As an example is better than words...

Let's say you want to store 3 frames of the same track. The first frame is 800 octets long, the second is 500 octets long and the third is 1000 octets long. As these data are small, you can store them in a lace to save space. They will then be solved in the same block as follows:

#### Xiph lacing

*   Block head (with lacing bits set to 01)
*   Lacing head: Number of frames in the lace -1, i.e. 2 (the 800 and 500 octets one)
*   Lacing sizes: only the 2 first ones will be coded, 800 gives 255;255;255;35, 500 gives 255;245\. The size of the last frame is deduced from the total size of the Block.
*   Data in frame 1
*   Data in frame 2
*   Data in frame 3

A frame with a size multiple of 255 is coded with a 0 at the end of the size, for example 765 is coded 255;255;255;0.

#### EBML lacing

In this case the size is not coded as blocks of 255 bytes, but as a difference with the previous size and this size is coded as in EBML. The first size in the lace is unsigned as in EBML. The others use a range shifting to get a sign on each value :

<pre>1xxx xxxx                                                                              - value -(2^6-1) to  2^6-1

                                                                                        (ie 0 to 2^7-2 minus 2^6-1, half of the range)

01xx xxxx  xxxx xxxx                                                                   - value -(2^13-1) to 2^13-1

001x xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx                                                        - value -(2^20-1) to 2^20-1

0001 xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx                                             - value -(2^27-1) to 2^27-1

0000 1xxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx                                  - value -(2^34-1) to 2^34-1

0000 01xx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx                       - value -(2^41-1) to 2^41-1

0000 001x  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx            - value -(2^48-1) to 2^48-1

</pre>

*   Block head (with lacing bits set to 11)
*   Lacing head: Number of frames in the lace -1, i.e. 2 (the 800 and 400 octets one)
*   Lacing sizes: only the 2 first ones will be coded, 800 gives 0x320 0x4000 = 0x4320, 500 is coded as -300 : - 0x12C + 0x1FFF + 0x4000 = 0x5ED3\. The size of the last frame is deduced from the total size of the Block.
*   Data in frame 1
*   Data in frame 2
*   Data in frame 3

#### Fixed-size lacing

In this case only the number of frames in the lace is saved, the size of each frame is deduced from the total size of the Block. For example, for 3 frames of 800 octets each :

*   Block head (with lacing bits set to 10)
*   Lacing head: Number of frames in the lace -1, i.e. 2
*   Data in frame 1
*   Data in frame 2
*   Data in frame 3


#### SimpleBlock Structure

The SimpleBlock is very inspired by the [Block structure](#block_structure). The main differences are the added Keyframe flag and Discardable flag. Otherwise everything is the same.

Size = 1 + (1-8) + 4 + (4 + (4)) octets. So from 6 to 21 octets.

Bit 0 is the most significant bit.

Frames using references should be stored in "coding order". That means the references first and then the frames referencing them. A consequence is that timecodes may not be consecutive. But a frame with a past timecode must reference a frame already known, otherwise it's considered bad/void.

There can be many Blocks in a BlockGroup provided they all have the same timecode. It is used with different parts of a frame with different priorities.

| (possibly) Laced Data |
| 0x00 | must | Consecutive laced frames |


#### EncryptedBlock Structure

The EncryptedBlock is very inspired by the [SimpleBlock structure](#simpleblock_structure). The main differences is that the raw data are Transformed. That means the data after the lacing definition (if present) have been processed before put into the Block. The laced sizes apply on the decoded (Inverse Transform) data. This size of the Transformed data may not match the size of the initial chunk of data.

The other difference is that the number of frames in the lace are not saved if "no lacing" is specified (bits 5 and 6 set to 0).

The Transformation is specified by a TransformID in the Block (must be the same for all frames within the EncryptedBlock).

Size = 1 + (1-8) + 4 + (4 + (4)) octets. So from 6 to 21 octets.

Bit 0 is the most significant bit.

Frames using references should be stored in "coding order". That means the references first and then the frames referencing them. A consequence is that timecodes may not be consecutive. But a frame with a past timecode must reference a frame already known, otherwise it's considered bad/void.

There can be many Blocks in a BlockGroup provided they all have the same timecode. It is used with different parts of a frame with different priorities.

| 0x01 / 0xXX | must* | Lace-coded size of each frame of the lace, except for the last one (multiple uint8). *This is not used with Fixed-size lacing as it is calculated automatically from (total size of lace) / (number of frames in lace). |
| (possibly) Laced Data |
| 0x00 | must | TransformID (EBML coded integer value). Value 0 = Null Transform |
| 0x01+ | must | Consecutive laced frames |


#### Virtual Block

The data in matroska is stored in coding order. But that means if you seek to a particular point and a frame has been referenced far away, you won't know while playing and you might miss this frame (true for independent frames and overlapping of dependent frames). So the idea is to have a placeholder for the original frame in the timecode (display) order.

The structure is a scaled down version of the normal [Block](#block).
